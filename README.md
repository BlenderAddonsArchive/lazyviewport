**What does it do?**

A simple addon for blender to map the standard G, R, S hotkeys to the view tools, so you don't have to use the snapping hotkeys X, Y, Z. 

**Instructions:**
1. Download the .zip file using the green button "Code" and then the drop menu button "download zip"
2. Extract the zip.
3. In blender, go to Preferecens>Addons>Install and navigate to your extracted lazyviewport.py 

Once installed, use G, R, S with the user friendly viewport gizmo tools :) 

**Edge/Vert Slide:**
Use shift+v. You can also do these via the menus in edit mode. 
The standard "G" then "G" does not work with the standard Blender view tools, thus not working with the Lazy Viewport Add On. 

**Rotation Snap:**
Use ctrl+left click to snap incrementally. 
The standard stapping with the 90 degree hotkeys oes not work with the standard Blender view tools, thus not working with the Lazy Viewport Add On. 

Yay for lazyness!
